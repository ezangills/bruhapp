# Contracts:

1. contracts/SoulboundToken.sol - token to add skill points to users. Non-transferable NFT representing a user’s skill.
2. contracts/SkillVerifier.sol - ZK-proof verifier of the skill. On-chain ZK-proof verifier (generated by snarkjs).
3. contracts/ZKSoulboundMinter.sol - binds SkillVerifier and SoulboundToken together, it acts as a gatekeeper for minting skill tokens, It verifies this proof using your on-chain ZK verifier contract (SkillVerifier). If the proof is valid and the user hasn’t already minted for that skill, it mints a SoulboundToken for the user, representing that skill. Connects ZK verification to minting skill NFTs (the bridge). ZKSoulboundMinter is the contract that ensures only users who can prove (in zero-knowledge) their skill can mint a soulbound skill token.

npx hardhat run scripts/deploySoulboundToken.js --network localhost
npx hardhat run scripts/deploySkillVerifier.js --network localhost





 needa 



 deploy to testnet (Sepolia or Base Goerli)







 How to use:
Deploy SoulboundToken and SkillVerifier as before.
Deploy ZKSoulboundMinter, passing the addresses of the other two contracts to its constructor.
Users call mintWithProof with their proof, public input, and desired skill name. If the proof is valid, they receive a soulbound skill token.
This is a real ZK-gated skill NFT system!
If you want a deployment script for all three contracts, or a sample frontend call, let me know!
